The objective of the game is to capture or block all of your opponents' pieces.

The game is solely played on the black fields and the player with the black/red pieces must begin.
Every piece that is not a king can only move forward. When a piece is crowned it gains the right
to also move backwards.
A piece can move one step in diagonal direction, if the destination field is empty.
If the field next to the start field is taken by an opponents' piece, but the field behind it
is free, a piece can jump over the opponents' piece to capture it.
If a player can't make any more moves, due to either losing all his pieces or being blocked by the opponents' pieces,
he loses.

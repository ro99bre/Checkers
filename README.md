Checkers is an old board game, which is traditionally played on the dark squares of a chess board. 
It's made for two players who oppose each other across the board. 
Each player has 12 pieces in the beginning and is trying to reach the other end of the board to gain more power.
The objective of the game is to capture or block all of your opponents' pieces.

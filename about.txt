This is Checkers (board game) built as a group project for the lecture
"Software Engineering" at HTWG Konstanz.

Checkers is an old board game, which is traditionally played on the dark squares
of a chess board.
It's made for two players who oppose each other across the board.
Each player has 12 pieces in the beginning and is trying to reach the other end
of the board to gain more power.
The objective of the game is to capture or block all of your opponents' pieces.
